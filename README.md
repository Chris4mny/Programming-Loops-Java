# ProgrammingLoops

App 06 
Programming Loops 
 
App 06 is “task oriented”.  It tells you exactly what your method should produce. 
App 07 will practice the same skills as part of a problem/solution scenario. 
 
Course Learning Outcomes:  1, 2, 3, 5, 6 
IT Learning Outcomes:  1, 4, 7 
SD Learning Outcomes:  1, 3, 4 
 
The purpose of this App is for you to practice writing the syntax that causes your method to implement a loop and to see how the method behaves based on the loop’s logical expression being true or false. 
 
For parts 1 through 4 (1A, 1B, 1C, 1D), inputs can be via showInputDialog() or the scanner.  
Outputs can be via showMessageDialog() or the console.    
For parts 5 through 7 (1E, 1F, 2), you must use showInputDialog() for all inputs and showMessageDialog() for all outputs. 
 
Create a appropriate methods in a java program in eclipse to implement each part of this Lab.   
 
Each numbered part should be a method that is called from the constructor. 
 
Be very careful with your white space as inappropriate white space will lower your score. 
 
Requirements: 
1	while loops - Your first six loops (A – F) will implement ‘while’ loops, some pre-test and some post-test. 
A	Your first method should implement a ‘pre-test while’ loop that contains a counting variable. 
a	Display the counting variable’s value immediately after it is initialized. 1 Be sure to specify where in the program this value emanates from. 
b	Display the counting variable’s value each time the loop executes.  
1	Be sure to specify these values are emanating from inside the loop. 
c	Display the counting variable’s value after the program exits the loop. 
1	Be sure to specify these values are emanating from outside the loop and after the loop was exited. d Create five ‘pre-test while’ loops that execute in sequence: 
1	Count from 1 to 10 
2	Count from 10 to 1 
3	Count from -10 to +10 
4	Count from -1001 to +251 in steps of 32 
5	Count from +253 to -1001 in steps of -64 
 
B	Your second method should demonstrate a ‘post-test while’ loop. 
a	Inside the loop have the user input a student’s name. 
1	If the student’s name is “No More Students” end the loop. 2 If the student has any other name display the statement: 
“<student name> has joined the group”

C	Your third method should implement a loop that allows you to input integers until you input the value, -99.  When the input value is -99, the loop should cease to execute.  For each execution of the loop, display the integer that was input. a Test the loop by entering five values with -99 as the 5th input. b Test the loop by entering as many values as you please (a minimum of 4 inputs).  The first value input must be 0. 
c Test the loop by entering as many values as you please (a minimum of 4 inputs).  The first value input must be -99. 
   
D	Your fourth method should implement a loop that allows you to input data until you input the string “-99”.  When the input value is “-99”, stop executing the loop.  For each execution of the loop, display the user input.  This time, when “-99” is entered, do not display the “-99”. 
a	Test the loop by entering five values with -99 as the 5th input. 
b	Test the loop by entering as many values as you please (a minimum of 4 inputs).  The first value input must be 0. 
c	Test the loop by entering as many values as you please (a minimum of 4 inputs).  The first value input must be -99. 
 
E	Your fifth method should implement a loop that allows you to input doubles until the value   -99.99 is input.  As the loop executes, display the value entered and a value that is one-half of the value that was entered, separating the two numbers with a tab.  Do not display the -99.99. 
a	Determine a series of appropriate test inputs. 
1	Why did you choose the particular test inputs you chose? 
 
F	Your sixth method should implement a loop that accepts names until a trailer is encountered . a Make the trailer the string “I am a silly duck”. 
b Determine a series of appropriate test inputs. 
1 Why did you choose the particular test inputs you chose? 
 
2	for loops - Your seventh method will implement a ‘for’ loop.   A Display the loop variable each time the loop executes.  
a Create five ‘for’ loops that execute in sequence to (each in a different loop): 
1	Count from 1 to 10 
2	Count from 10 to 1 
3	Count from -10 to +10 
4	Count from -1000 to +521 in steps of 23 
5	Count from +523 to -1000 in steps of -46
